# Clear-Witcher-3-Inessential-Files

Solution made with UWP to delete the unneccessary files from The Witcher 3 game so as to make some space available.

This works for Epic Games version of The Witcher 3 as I have that game only there and not on Steam... But I think it might work since the game directories are similar regardless of the platform we used to buy the game.


How to run the solution?
1. Make sure you have Visual Studio installed and support for creating application with Universsal Windows Platform.
2. Then just download the files from this repository and run the "UWP_1.sln" file and this project will be loaded in Visual Studio.
3. After that, just press "ctrl + F5" or "Start without debugging", and the application will run. Then follow the steps below.


How it works?
1. Click the "crossed swords" icon and give the location of the "TheWitcher3" folder, basically where it is installed (most probably in C drive), the root directory of the game.
For example, C > Program Files (x86) > TheWitcher3. Choose TheWitcher3 folder, or whatever is the name.
2. Then you will get a pop-up about the chosen folder, after that click on "Delete Files" and once it will be finished, you will receive pop-up that the files have been deleted.
