# Clear-Witcher-3-Inessential-Files

This program removes non-en files from The Witcher 3 game.
Solution is made with UWP to delete the unneccessary files from The Witcher 3 game so as to make some space available.

This works for Epic Games version of The Witcher 3 as I have that game only there and not on Steam... But I think it might work since the game directories are similar regardless of the platform we used to buy the game.

How to install?
1. In the "AppPackages" folder, install the file by double-clicking "UWP_1_1.0.2.0_x86_x64_arm_Debug.appx".
2. Follow the steps as mentioned above.

Or if want to make a fresh solutions to improve code or to customize, do the following:
1. Make sure you have Visual Studio installed and support for creating application with Universsal Windows Platform.
2. Then just download the files from this repository and run the "UWP_1.sln" file and this project will be loaded in Visual Studio.
3. Now you can edit the code, and do something with it or improve the code.
4. After that, just press "ctrl + F5" or "Start without debugging", and the application will run.


How it works?
1. Click the "crossed swords" icon and give the location of the "TheWitcher3" folder, basically where it is installed (most probably in C drive), the root directory of the game.
For example, C > Program Files (x86) > TheWitcher3. Choose TheWitcher3 folder, or whatever is the name.
2. Then you will get a pop-up about the chosen folder, after that click on "Delete Files" and once it will be finished, you will receive pop-up that the files have been deleted (it might take some time for the files to bed deleted and the pop-up to appear, as I have selected default option for deletion in which, the deleted files would be moved to Recycle Bin).
